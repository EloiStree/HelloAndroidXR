Question : Que sera le jeu vidéo dans 70 ans ?

Depending on how the interview is going 4 idea of discussion come to my mind:
- A portable computer block that communicate with your headset with GPC, CPU and AI power locally to delegate tasks from the game / app
- A video game for who ? Human or machine ? Because of the raise of AI, lost of small game are created to train the AI .
- Game in mixed reality that need to interact together to share a space with other applications (Example: Tamagotchi that need to understand that in the room he is there are other Tamagotchi, calendar, poster, app , forbidden zone, etc.
- Mixed reality vs Virtual reality what are the stop point where we have everything we need and science can provide ?
- Topic I don't like is the: Google Glass and Facebook AR glass . Because it is to much glury on what it will become.
- Play on virtual big screen... Play on stereo big screen at home... Play a tekken emulation on your couch (already exists ^^... Crazy
  - So why not classic game having 3D XR Option more and more

- It is really hard to answer a 70 year old... 8 years ago, I through we were far of Ghost in the shell. 4 years ago, I realized that Oculus Quest 2 is the same as some part of this manga. This year, AI allows to have some other par of this manga...
  - Want to have fun on the topic. Watch the best futuristic movie and how close we are from the realistic part of them...
